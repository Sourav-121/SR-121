### üß† Algorithm Philosophy:
SR is a custom-designed symmetric cryptographic algorithm developed to encrypt and decrypt messages composed of letters and digits. It is designed for secure handling of variable-length input. 

---

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities:

- **Symmetric Encryption**  
  Uses the same transformation logic for both encryption and decryption, ensuring perfect reversibility without complex key exchanges.

- **Letter & Digit Support**  
  Fully supports alphanumeric characters, including uppercase/lowercase letters (`A‚ÄìZ`, `a‚Äìz`) and numerical digits (`0‚Äì9`).

- **Flexible Input Size**  
  Capable of encrypting and decrypting strings of any length, from single characters to full sentences or codes.

- **Custom Logic**  
  Built on original algorithmic principles designed by the author, ideal for educational, experimental, and lightweight cryptographic applications.

## üîê Encryption Process:

The encryption process follows a position-aware and key-based mapping system. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### üì• Steps for Encryption:

1. **Determine position:**  
   Let `xi` be the position (0‚Äì35) of the *i-th* character from the plaintext, using the character-to-value table.

2. **Extend key:**  
   Repeat or truncate the key's digits to match the length of the plaintext. Let `Ki` be the digit at position *i* in the extended key.

3. **Compute new position according to key:**  
   Calculate the transformed index using:  
   

\[
   N_i = (x_i + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor) \mod 36
   \]


   where `k` is the key .

4. **Now Encrypt using the following formula:**  
   

\[
   C_i = \left( K_i + \left( (N_i + 121) \mod 36 \right) \right) \mod 36
   \]



5. **Map to encrypted character:**  
   Use the value `Ci` from  the position table.
