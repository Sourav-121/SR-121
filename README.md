### üß† Algorithm Philosophy:
SR is a custom-designed symmetric cryptographic algorithm developed to encrypt and decrypt messages composed of letters and digits. It is designed for secure handling of variable-length input. 

---

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities:

- **Symmetric Encryption**  
  Uses the same transformation logic for both encryption and decryption, ensuring perfect reversibility without complex key exchanges.

- **Letter & Digit Support**  
  Fully supports alphanumeric characters, including uppercase/lowercase letters (`A‚ÄìZ`, `a‚Äìz`) and numerical digits (`0‚Äì9`).

- **Flexible Input Size**  
  Capable of encrypting and decrypting strings of any length, from single characters to full sentences or codes.

- **Custom Logic**  
  Built on original algorithmic principles designed by the author, ideal for educational, experimental, and lightweight cryptographic applications.
